# Space Planner
Factorio mod for planning out a base

Use a collection of free parts to lay out key sections of your base before you build. This will help you with space planning and minimize the amount of tear down and rebuild you'll need to do.

## How to Use
After researching Space Planner, build planning blocks from the production tab. The blocks are free, instant build and come in stacks of 100. When placed on the ground they can be walked over and should not be attacked. They can be instantly removed by right clicking.

## Parts Available
 * Small (1x1), medium (2x2) and large (3x3) generic blocks that can represent anything that fits those sizes.
 * Transport belt blocks are given a unique icon to represent belt locations.
 * Inserter blocks are given a unique icon to represent inserter locations.
 * Train station blocks are 2x7 and show where a train will line up within the block. These do not adhere to the train grid, so it is highly recommended to build a single section of rail and a train station, place the planning blocks, and remove the train station if desired.

## Known Issues
 * None of the blocks rotate.
 * Even though the blocks can be removed quickly, they are not automatically removed when building on top of them.
 * The train station is horizontal only.
